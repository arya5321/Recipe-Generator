# Recipe-Generator
A fine-tuned version of the Llama-2-7b model, specifically optimized through Lora and Peft techniques. The model, named "NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf," has been fine-tuned to enhance its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant recipe suggestions.

# Dataset and Hugging Face Repository
The dataset used for fine-tuning adheres to the Llama template, structured to facilitate effective training and deployment of the recipe generation model. This dataset has been uploaded and made accessible on Hugging Face under the repository "arya123321/generation," enabling seamless integration and utilization by the community.

# Prompt Engineering for Recipe Generation
Prompt engineering techniques have been employed to refine the model's ability to respond to specific prompts related to recipe requests. This approach ensures that the model generates recipes tailored to user input, taking into account ingredients, dietary preferences, and cooking instructions.
